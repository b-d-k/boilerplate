# Grid Boilerplate

A quick and dirty boilerpate to throw together some sample code.

Made with

* HTML5 Boilerplate (random parts removed, https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate)
* Lost Grid (https://github.com/peterramsing/lost)
* Node-Sass (https://github.com/sass/node-sass)

`gulp` runs sass and watch.  
No server included, just run `http-server` (`npm install http-server -g`)
